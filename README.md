# Ratatouille
**A recipe app inspired by the Pixar movie Ratatouille** :mouse:
> 
*Built using Swift and SwiftUI*

This Project was my final exam for the iOS Development course at Kristiania University College.

The app uses [The Meal DB](https://www.themealdb.com), a free API that provides a large number of recipes from all over the world! :earth_americas:

:rocket: **Functionality**
> - Search for recipes by *area*, *category*, *ingredient* or *text search*
> - View recipe details
> - Save recipes as favorites to your device using **CoreData**
> - Edit, archive and delete recipes, ingredients and more
> - Supports dark mode
> - Incorporates [FlagsAPI](https://flagsapi.com)
